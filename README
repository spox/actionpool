        == ActionPool ==
~Who doesn't love a pool with action?~

ActionPool is just a simple thread pool. It allows
for various contraints and resizing in a pretty
easy and unobtrusive manner. You can set limits
on how long tasks are worked on, as well as on the
life of a thread. For things that like to use lots
threads, it can be helpful to reuse threads instead of
constantly recreating them.

install (easy):

gem install ActionPool

install (less easy):

git clone http://github.com/spox/actionpool.git
cd actionpool
gem build actionpool.gemspec
gem install ActionPool-x.x.x.gem

It has RDocs. They are where ever your rubygems installed them.
They will probably be helpful to look over.

Simple example of using the pool:

pool = ActionPool::Pool.new
pool.process do
    puts "Hello world"
    sleep(1)
    puts "Goodbye world"
end
puts "Hello to you too"

Result:
Hello world
Hello to you too
Goodbye world
